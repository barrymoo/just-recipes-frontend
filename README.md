# just-recipes-frontend
[WIP] An Elm front-end for our Just Recipes website

## Prerequisites

- [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)

## Run the current example

- Start development server

```
elm reactor
```

- Open `localhost:8000` in your browser
- Click `src`
- Click `Main.elm`

## To Do

- Re-architect Main.elm to deal with multiple apps
  on a single page (requires reading!)
- `Recipes.Add`, when exists, would benefit from
  - Auto-add item if box is not empty
  - Auto-collapse empty boxes at end
